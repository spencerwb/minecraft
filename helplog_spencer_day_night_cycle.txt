If the demo sky code doesnt show anything then it may be because the alpha is zero because the demo outputs a vec3 instead of a vec4

Another problem: try to only have a single out vector in your fragment shader, if you have multiple, then im not sure how the fragment shader decides which out vector is the color

The sky demo causes your program to run so slowly because to render to your high pixel density screen, it takes more render time so i guess from now on were using a small sized window

I think I may have fixed the falling through terrain problem by adding a terminal velocity component to the readUserInput function when the player is falling gin aerial mode
