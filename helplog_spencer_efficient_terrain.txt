If you get an undefined reference to vtable error, it's because
you don't have a destructor defined for the class that it's
complaining about.

I kind of just forgot how to return values by reference, but retaught myself
how by going on this website...
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/returning_values_by_reference.htm
You just need to declare the return value as a TYPE& in the function
signature and return something of type TYPE and it will automatically
return to the calling function a reference to the return value.

There are many pitfalls in my code where bugs could exist. First of all,
I don't know how bitwise operation works on primitives of different types
since I'm shifting around int64_t and bit-oring it with a regular int. I don't
know if it does sign extension or just adds a bunch of zeroes when attempting
to perform these operations.

you to close the terminal window, that may be because you did not
call the destroy function for one of your drawable objects in the
destructor of MyGL

Include the following line of code in either MyGL or the Player class
(whichever one is handling the new generation of Terrain objects which
should probably be MyGL)
QThreadPool::globalInstance()->start(pointer to Terrain object to generate FBM for);
