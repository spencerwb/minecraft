Changed the grid-tracing function a lot so that it also registers WATER  and LAVA blocks as permeable
Added LAVA and WATER as BlockTypes
Added a new postprocessshader class

[HELP_LOG]

the Terrain class contains a map of 16 chunks (4x4)
each chunk contains 16x16x256 blocks

Tips on doing day and night cycle

My multithreading is causing my program to crash
My program cometimes crashes when you first run and then crashes

Transparent quad is not following the player




Make your terrain hilly with curvature by using a noise function
Add distance fog (use the fragment shader to have the color blend in with the color of the sky based on distance)
Add light mapping
Add neon lights 
Recreate Pandora

std::queue::push(val)
Inserts a new element at the end of the queue, after its current last element. The content of this new element is initialized to val.

This member function effectively calls the member function push_back of the underlying container object.

std::queue::pop()
Removes the next element in the queue, effectively reducing its size by one.

The element removed is the "oldest" element in the queue whose value can be retrieved by calling member queue::front.

This calls the removed element's destructor.

This member function effectively calls the member function pop_front of the underlying container object.
